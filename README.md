## Notes

- Running uninstall will remove Vanguard files and stop the services. You will need to reboot your PC after uninstalling.  
- Changing startup behavior affects whether Vanguard runs automatically when Windows boots.  
- If services fail to stop or start, ensure you are running the script as Administrator.  
- Vanguard may restart automatically in some cases.
